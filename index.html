        <p> I was born in Tulsa Oklahoma and lived there for about 6 months before moving away. I have only one sibling, a sister who is older by 7 years and one day. </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>I love living in Seattle near the water, and in the middle of the city surrounded by activity. My boyfriend Jason and I moved here from Denver about two years ago. We loved Denver, but we were ready to explore all the new opportunities awaiting us in Seattle.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p> I am a true animal lover, which is obvious as soon as you walk into my home. My current menagerie consists of a cat named 'Halley', a dog named 'Vito', and 6 birds named 'Kevin', 'Cricket', 'Skye', 'Jesse', 'Salty', and 'Dusty'.</p>

      </li>
      <li>
        <p> My boyfriend and I are huge hockey fans and our favorite teams are the Philadelphia Flyers and Colorado Avalanche. I miss being able to go to NHL games, but still try not to miss a game on TV.</p>
